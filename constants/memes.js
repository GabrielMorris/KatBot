  cocoa: `<@278301453620084736>, you live with one hundred percent of yourself at all times, you have never felt anything that has not reverberated through every nerve of your body, never done anything you cared about without it being the most important thing in your world, even if it’s hard for you to understand what it is they are. Your beliefs are as strong and beautiful as they are fragile, like tempered glass encaging your heart to protect it. you love deeply, helplessly; you’ve never been able to stop yourself from caring, even as it burned. You wish you were the person you want to be, but you wish even more that you knew who the person you want to be is. You ache for emotional stability, and try as hard as you can to place roots in others who seem to already know who they are. You are strong, and beautiful, and terrified. and it seems as though you can only seem the latter part of yourself, no matter how bright the first two shine.`,
